Week 2

This week I used AI to help me with my lecture notes and study python. 
I asked ChatGPT to think through my notes and summarize them into clear main points so that I could review and study more effectively. 
Also, I asked to explain python for me and teach me the basics of python.
This made it easier for me to focus on the key ideas from the lecture instead of reading through all the raw notes as well as
simple descriptions of python.
